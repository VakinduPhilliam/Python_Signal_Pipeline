# Python_Signal_Pipeline
This series of scripts is written to demonstrate the process of Python Signal Handling. The 'signal' module sets handlers for asynchronous events. This module provides mechanisms to use signal handlers in Python. The signal.signal() function allows defining custom handlers to be executed when a signal is received. A small number of default handlers are installed: SIGPIPE is ignored (so write errors on pipes and sockets can be reported as ordinary Python exceptions) and SIGINT is translated into a KeyboardInterrupt exception.  A handler for a particular signal, once set, remains installed until it is explicitly reset (Python emulates the BSD style interface regardless of the underlying implementation), with the exception of the handler for SIGCHLD, which follows the underlying implementation.
